# Esperanza ☀

### The last resort for everyday human language misunderstandings.

Go beyond, man.

What matters the most is the way you talk and you move.

Words are important? Sure. **Important != Most important**.

### Not convinced yet?

Chill out, and ask for `Esperanza.help?`

## Contributing

Rules are required to make Esperenza say hopeful things, for now it's just lazy and will say things innapropriate (sorry for that). So.. help!

## Use with caution

This gem is hitting wikipedia/tionary pages. It's not meant to do that every .5 seconds, so.. you know what you are doing. Be polite.
